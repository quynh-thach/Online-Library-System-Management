# Library-System
In the library system, the name and the number of copies of a book is recorded.\
Books are available for being checked out and in.\
3 is the maximum number of books can be checked out at a time,\
One can check out only ONE copy of a specific book.\
Books must be checked back in by the fourth day after being checking out.\
For every 5 days after the book is checked out, the patron is charged a flat fee of $12. Patrons have an
account balance, and they can make payments so as to clear their account. In addition, we will need
some helper methods to help the library administrator view the book/patron records, as well as to find
specific books/patrons, and also to update the late fees on a daily basis.
